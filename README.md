- Google Advanced Search page with four options stacked vertically:

  - "none of these words"
- Advanced Search button should be blue with white text and take user to search results page
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page, taking user directly to the first search result

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to access the Google Search page.

3. Navigate between pages using links in the upper-right corner.

4. Type in a query on the Google Search page or the Google Image Search page and click the search button to view results.

5. On the Google Advanced Search page, provide input for the four options and click the Advanced Search button to view results.

6. Click the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page to bypass the normal results page and go directly to the first search result.

7. Enjoy the Google-like aesthetics of the website.

## Note

You may encounter a redirect notice when using the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
